## Removal of member from Board

1. The Central Government may remove a member of the Board from it, if heâ€”
    1. is, or at any time has been, adjudged as insolvent; or
    2. is, or becomes, of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; or
    3. refuses to act or becomes incapable of acting as a member of the Board; or
    4. has been convicted of an offence which, in the opinion of the Central Government, involves moral turpitude; or
    5. has so abused, in the opinion of the Central Government, his position as a member of the Board as to render his continuance in the Board detrimental to the interests of the general public.
2. Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no member shall be removed from his office on the grounds specified in clauses (c) to (e) of that sub-section unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the matter.
